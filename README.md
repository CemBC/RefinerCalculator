#Refined Calculator

In this small project , I tried to facilitate refining process calculation for Albion Online users.
For usage tips , around the tab you can select different functions such as calculating needed raw 
according to wanted refined value or vice versa. Also extra 2 tab had been added for stone enchanments.
At 5th tab you can see your function history for refine calcutor for both stone and other materials.
At the Tier section "1" means you are calculating for needed lower tier.
Also you can select both "%10 activity" and "%20 activity" in the same time but it will count as only "%10 activity" selected
